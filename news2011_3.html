Twenty eight year 1 students    majored in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering took this 20-hour course. Students formed six groups, each designed and fabricated a radio controlled aircraft model using foam board. Each group was led by a 3rd year student who actively participated in the activivities organized by model team last year. These models were all powered by a brushless motor and a four cell lithium battery. This activity was organized and financially supported by Dr. Gao of Turbulence Control Lab. </span></p>
